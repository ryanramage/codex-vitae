# Codex Vitae

A living and dying record of my beliefs.

This is a public, living, dying, document. I’m attempting to be as specific as possible and to quickly correct errors when they become apparent.

## Work

Project based work has been more valuable to me than management positions ❤️

---

Having skills that complete work is more valuable than being in a middle management position ❤️

## Universe

Watching the sky and stars has brought me great joy. Spend time looking for the northern lights, constellations, meteor showers, satellites. Also it has helped me understand foundational truths like the earth is round ❤️

---

The solar system we inhabit was born like all other systems, and there is nothing inherently unique about it 💪

## Relationships

I am really starting to understand that the first commandment is to know thyself.

Soulmates don't exist ❤️ 🐲

When people discuss arguments they are usually refining their ideas rather than being absolutely committed to what they are saying. Unfortunately, speaking something also tends to cement a belief.

Imagine being mute and maybe less able to plan. Many species experience living with emotions and thoughts at that level. It's probably a stretch to imagine how they feel.

Life exists in other pockets of the universe. Some is as intelligent as us.

Humans will eventually create intelligent life.

Humans will create intelligent life that will be better suited than themselves for living and conquering space.

The first interaction with non-earth life will occur using intelligent robot probes humans have designed for the task.

Swearing and cussing are an important adult skill that should be used in moderation. It is fucking effective when delivered appropriately.

There is no absolutes called 'telling the truth' or 'lying'.

Humans wear different personas depending on situations. Driving a car or playing sports are prime examples.

Admit quickly when mistakes were made. Act graciously when others admit the've made mistakes.

Justice should be swift and small. Trajectories correct easier earlier.

In a disagreement make sure to really understand the point of view being presented from all sides. Ask questions in earnest. Ensure the argument is not because of a communication breakdown.


Kids - too early - you were not ready for the consequeneces of having childern
     - too late - Physical issues with tiredness, or complications
     - too many - each child compounds the risk of less attention and complications


Strive for novel experiences over wealth. They are related but not the same.

I have been happiest when my calendar is filled with diverse activities which involve interesting people.

Eat less. Three meals a day is a lie
