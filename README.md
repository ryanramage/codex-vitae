# Codex Vitae

A living and dying record of my beliefs.

This is a public, living, dying, document. I’m attempting to be as specific as possible and to quickly correct errors when they become apparent.

### Legend

Project based work has been more valuable to me than management positions ❤️

Having skills that complete work is more valuable than being in a middle management position ❤️

Watching the sky and stars has brought me great joy. Spend time looking for the northern lights, constellations, meteor showers, satellites. Also it has helped me understand foundational truths like the earth is round ❤️

The solar system we inhabit was born like all other systems, and there is nothing inherently unique about it 💪

Relationships work best when you know thyself

Soulmates don't exist ❤️ 🐲

When people discuss arguments they are usually refining their ideas rather than being absolutely committed to what they are saying. Unfortunately, speaking something also tends to cement a belief.

Imagine being mute and maybe less able to plan. Many species experience living with emotions and thoughts at that level. It's probably a stretch to imagine how they feel.

Life exists in other pockets of the universe. Some is as intelligent as us.

Humans will eventually create intelligent life.

Humans will create intelligent life that will be better suited than themselves for living and conquering space.

The first interaction with non-earth life will occur using intelligent robot probes humans have designed for the task.

Swearing and cussing are an important adult skill that should be used in moderation. It is fucking effective when delivered appropriately.

There are no absolutes called 'telling the truth' or 'lying'.

Humans wear different personas depending on situations. Driving a car or playing sports are prime examples.

Admit quickly when mistakes were made. Act graciously when others admit the've made mistakes.

Justice should be swift and small. Trajectories correct easier earlier.

In a disagreement make sure to really understand the point of view being presented from all sides. Ask questions in earnest. Ensure the argument is not because of a communication breakdown.

Kids - too early - you were not ready for the consequences of having children
     - too late - Physical issues with tiredness, or complications
     - too many - each child compounds the risk of less attention and complications


Strive for novel experiences over wealth. They are related but not the same.

I have been happiest when my calendar is filled with diverse activities which involve interesting people.

Boredom is one of the most useful tools to spark creativity

Eat less. Three meals a day is a lie

Buying used is the best

Abortion is a justifiable action an individual can take.

Cutting up a healthy individual to save dozens of sick individuals is wrong.

A life does not begin at birth, it begins millions of years before. An 'individual' is an unbroken chain of living information stretching back to the first replicating machine.

The main purpose of life is for an organism to sustain or increase the probability that it exists into the next moment.

Tertiary purposes of life is for an organism to sustain or increase the probability that is species exists into the next moment. This can be via altruism or reproduction

There are fundamental laws of the universe that are based around fields, waves and particles.

Strata of abstractions form above these fundamental laws because of exponential scaling of perspective. Quarks > atoms > molecules > elements > h2o > water. Our experience with water is at a very hight level of strata of abstraction.

At higher levels of abstraction from these fundamental laws, there are emergent patterns and behaviours. The machinery of life manipulates along strata.

Humanity now wields the power to destroy most life on this Earth. We have no idea how frail Earth is, but lets not test its limits.
